# Concept

My portofolio is my journey and exploration of various React libraries and my integration of UX perspective using Figma. My goal was to use popular React libraries such as Framer Motion, React Scroll, and React Icons to enhance my understanding of the React environment and build engaging user interfaces.

## React Libraries Explored

### 1. Framer Motion
[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) is a powerful animation library for React that allows for the creation of smooth, interactive animations. In this portfolio, I have explored Framer Motion to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of my projects.

### 2. React Scroll
[React Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll) is a library that enables smooth scrolling within a React application. I have used React Scroll to provide a seamless and pleasant scrolling experience for users navigating through my projects.

### 3. React Icons
[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) provides a vast collection of icons for use in React applications. I have leveraged React Icons to incorporate visually appealing icons that enhance the user interface of my projects.

## UX Integration with Figma

In addition to exploring React libraries, I have integrated a UX perspective into my projects using Figma. Figma has been a valuable tool for creating user interface designs, wireframes,my logo and all the pictures used within the Portofolio. By incorporating UX principles and iterating through designs in Figma, my aim was to enhance the usability and overall user experience of my applications.
